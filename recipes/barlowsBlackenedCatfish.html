        Cajun catfish served up with just the right touch of spices and flavor. 
        This entree is perfect for a quick, excellent way to taste the unique 
        flavor of catfish mixed with the traditional method of down south 
        cooking, just without all the fat. Serve on top of white rice.

             <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons pepper</li>
             <li>1 pound catfish fillets</li>

       <h3>Preparations</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a shallow, medium bowl, mix cayenne pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper.        
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush both sides of catfish fillets with butter. Rub fillets with the cayenne pepper
            mixture on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until really hot. Add fillets,
            and fry approximately 2 minutes on each side, until slightly blackened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange blackened fillets in a single layer in the prepared baking dish, and coat
            with Italian-style salad dressing. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven,
            until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
        </li>
       </ol>
